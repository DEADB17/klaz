Static generation of css classes using JavaScript based on the atomic/utility
class concept.

* Idea: Improve on atomic/utility classes

** Keep
- Single property classes
- Fixed property values (Reduce decision fatigue; keep consistency)
- Organized by break-points
- Separate from base classes

** Change
- Generate classes as they are used instead of pre-generating and purging
- Use programming language facilities for abstraction
- Write standard css properties and values but generate compact class names
- Remove break-points and pseudo-classes from class names


* Example
Writing

#+begin_src javascript
  kz`sm:hover:color:red`;
#+end_src

Returns a string with the class name

#+begin_src javascript
  "Hello"
#+end_src

As a side effect an internal style-sheet object is updated that when rendered
yields

#+begin_src css
  {}
#+end_src
